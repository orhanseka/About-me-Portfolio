📁 Interactive Portfolio — Finder-Inspired Personal Interface

A Premium Portfolio Experience Designed Under the SEKA Brand
This project delivers a modern, high-interaction personal portfolio experience inspired by the macOS Finder interface.
It blends clean UI/UX principles, custom animations, and SEKA’s premium design language into a fully interactive web environment.
Every part of the interface was built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
No UI libraries, no frameworks — completely handcrafted.
🚀 Project Vision
The goal is not to present a typical “scroll-down portfolio.”
Instead, this project provides a software-like, immersive, and high-quality interface that represents both technical capability and design precision.
It reflects the core principles of the SEKA brand:
clarity,
structural logic,
refined UX,
and product-level visual polish.
This is more than a portfolio — it’s a personal interface.
